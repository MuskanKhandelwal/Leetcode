A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It's commonly used to implement priority queues, where the most important or highest priority elements are always easy to access.

There are two types of heaps:

Max-Heap: In this type, the value of each parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This ensures that the maximum value is always at the root.

Min-Heap: In this type, the value of each parent node is less than or equal to the values of its children. This ensures that the minimum value is always at the root.
